Unit tests need refactoring. test_views is still pretty long.
Unit tests contain skips. Address when testing form validation.

FT breaks when invoice details are updated and a new line item isn't added.

form validation should be performed and also include checks that where expecting number values those are submitted. 

make form look more like an invoice. inputs that expect numbers should be of type number to help mobile users.

Functionality to add: 
delete line items, 
add users and protect their invoices from public, 
export as pdf
