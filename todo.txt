Unit tests to be refactored so that empty invoices that are being created (but not for testing empty invoice purposes) are built using the util.py create_new_invoice function

Unit tests need refactoring. test_views is really long.

FT breaks when invoice details are updated and a new line item isn't added. Unit tests need to be added for this and the ability to update the invoice without adding a new (blank) line item.

form validation should be performed and also include checks that where expecting number values those are submitted. 

make form look more like an invoice. inputs that expect numbers should be of type numberto help mobile users.

Functionality to add: 
delete line items, 
add users and protect their invoices from public, 
export as pdf
